* Multi Threading :
  -----------
   -> Control by the OS 

  Coroutines : 
  -----
   -> Can be controlled by us ie Cooperatively

* Synchronously :- Prog is not doing much on CPU (whilst waiting)

* CPU bound task :
   - data crunching

  IO bound task : 
    - File System Operation 
    - Network Operation

=> Using Threading help us lot in IO-bound tasks
=> Using CPU-bound for MultiProcessing is preferred 


* ThreadPoolExecutor :
  -------
   - module :- `concurrent.futures`  
   -> Easy to handle multiple threads 

   - same apis as of ProcessPoolExecutor


   as_completed()  // will provide completed result in order they were submitted 


* Application :
  ------
   - Downloading lots of things online

-> If somethig is doing lots of computation then Thread would not be ideal choice in such case
       
  Eg 
      [CPU-bound]
      accessing the photo & resizing them -> Not threads but MultiProcessing is useful
      
      [IO-bound]
      Downloading Photos -> Multi-Threading
