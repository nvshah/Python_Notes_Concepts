* Bounds Methods vs Normal|Free Methods :
  -------------------------
   Free Methods :- method reference via class ie ClassName.methodName 

   bound methods :- method reference via object ie instanceName.methodName
      \
       often takes place at runtime (ie dynamic) as method gets bounded to objects at dynamically


* Object & inheritance :
  ------
   With python3 everything class is inherited from an `object`
   whether you specify explicitly or not 

   ie  class A, 
       class B(),
       class C(object)

       All A,B,c are inherited from an `object` class 

* New OOPS (Python 3) comprises of new features :-
   - Descriptors
   - dunder method
   - MRO

* class methods vs static methods | Descriptors :
  ---------
  ref : mcoding

  => class methods are used exclusively (most common) for alternative constructors
     \
      from, make, create, ...

  Static Method :
   -> when you create static method it wraps a function
   -> & via Descripto protocol it returns that same func when demanded

  REMEMBER :
   -> Normal funciton follows Descriptor protocol
      Calling the __get__() on normal function will bind that func to provided specific instance !
