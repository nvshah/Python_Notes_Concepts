dunder_concepts

* __new__, __repr__, __iadd__

  __enter__, __exit__

* dunder for delete `del`
  |
  -> there are 3 dunders for `del` keyword (operation)

  1. __delitem__  // del x[0]

  2. __delattr__  // del x.a

  3. __del__      // del x


REMEMBER :
---
 -> __del__ is suppossed to be run when object ref count is hit to be 0

    So every time `del x` will not call __del__ every time
