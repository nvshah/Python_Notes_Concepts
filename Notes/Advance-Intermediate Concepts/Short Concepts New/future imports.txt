future imports


* __future__ imports :
  -----------------
  -> It really changes how python works behind (ie different bytes code gets generated for such kinda
     imports)
  -> It is doing something really fundamental (in C code as well)
  -> It is changing the way your python source code gets interpreted
  -> can change meaning of programs

* __future__.generator_stop
  -----------------------
  -> inorder to avoid amibgutiy between StopIteration Exception & Generator Improper access issue
     Generator Stop Exception is introduced

  -> NOTE : while looping if StopIteration Exception is raised it is silent by Python itself & loop is
            terminated
