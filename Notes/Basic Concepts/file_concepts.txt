[csv file reader] https://realpython.com/python-csv/

------------------

* When file open with context manager :
   \
    You still have access to file object outside but file will be closed


file obj ;-
     read()       // read enitre file at once 
     readline()   // read line by line 
     readlines()  // list of lines 

     tell()    // curr position
     seek()   // move file pointer

Be careful while writting to file that already exists


* Image file :
  ----
   - Inorder to work with images i.e 'jpg' we need to open file in binary mode.


* Csv file :
  ----
   module :- csv 

   => Its built on top of open() to reduce boiler plate code to read csv files content
      (Otherwise we need to process the strings)

   csv.reader()
      .writer()
        \
         writerow()
      .DictReader()
      .DictWriter()
          \
           .writeheader()
