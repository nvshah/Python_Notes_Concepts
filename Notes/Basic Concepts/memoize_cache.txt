* lru_cache:
  --------
   - functools 
   -> lru_cache uses dictionary underhood 

   [drawback]
   -> So You cannot use non-hashable argument for lru_cache decorated function 
   -> Thus You cannot use list or set as an argument to cache for lru_cached function

   [Soln]
   -> To overcome this drawback You can use Combination of `FrozenSet` & dict (ie HashMap)
