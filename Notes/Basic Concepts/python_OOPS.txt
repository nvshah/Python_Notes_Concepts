__________
Useful methods 

isinstance()
issubclass()


---------

=> In python you can get access to currently executing stack frame by :- inspect.currentframe()

=> To get the class name of any object in python :- obj.__class__.__name__

=> In python each & every concept, object has certain protocol (ie Dunder methods defined)
   to distinguish itself,
   & You need to bound to that protocol inorder to utilise the properties

=> class methods are used exclusively for alternative constructor (for Eg from_json())

---------


=> Normal Functions implement the descriptor protocol

-> to Check the object/instance namespace, use :- `__dict__`

-> to get help abt MRO & other details of class :- help(classname)

* new() vs init():
  ------------  
   __new__ :- call to create object 
   __init__ :- to add attrib to that object

   new :- return object 
   init :- do not return anything

   generlly signature of both are same

   new :- is a class method     (cls)
   init :- is a instance method (self)

   => Always remember to return something from new (as that is its job)

   new :- Change how obj is created


   init :- when called obj is already created 
   
   So if you want to perform anything during or before object creation use __new__ 
   else you can go with __init__

   So __new__ is often used when to deal with immutable object 
   as immutable obj cannot be altered once created 

* classmethod & staticmethod 
  ----------------
   to call classmethod from instance method use :- type(self).classMethodName()

   static methods :- dont pass any argument as first argument like `self` or `cls` 
                     Those are just regular function but 
                     we put them inside class just because they have some logical relation with them 
                     

* Class OOPs concepts also follow namespace :
  --------------
   First look at instance namespace (ie __dict__)
                 class namesapce    
                 parent class namespace (ie inheritance)


          
* Inheritance :
  -----

   Method Resolution Order :- (MRO)
   ---
   - Chain of Lookup for Methods & Arttributes 

   TIP :- to get idea abt MRO :- use `help(ClassName)`

   super :
   ----
    - to call parent class attributes 


* magic methods :
  -------
   - allows to emulate the builtin behaviour in python & also operator overloading

   1) __str__  | __repr__
        o.__repr__()  or repr(o)

   2) __add__
   3) __len__

* NotImplemented :
  ----
   If some operations throw NotImplemented exception then operand is checked either way to second
   side if there the operation is define or not !


* Property :
  ------
   get :- @property 
       :- defining the getter property as a method but can access it like a property/attribute
       :- no need () while invoking

   setter :
       @name.setter   // name is name of the property (ie getter property)

   deleter :
       @name.deleter  // dispose the resources of an instance 

       Eg :- del obj.name 

--------- Advance ------------

* super() :   // MISC TOPIC 
  ------
   UseCase :
   |
    -> LoggingDict -> ie While Setting or getting Item of Dict (via Custom Dict)

   TIPS (REMEMBER)
   
   > super doesnt necessary call your parent (ie it may call ancestor's version as well, possibly)
   > super can access sibblings

   MRO (Method Resolution Order)
   -----
    To get mro for any class -> ClassName.__mro__  // returns list of ordered search for method

   super => next in line in MRO's list 
   
   REMEMBER :- 
    -> with Single innheritance next in line is always the Parent 
    -> with multiple inheritance next in line is not always the Parent (it may be Sibblings)
  
  Q) What actually super() is ??
   ->
     super() := returns instance of Super Class
        \
  * Proxy Object 
    ____________
         -> instance of Super class is called as Proxy Object 
         -> It's simply a wrapper class that holds the obj & provide attribute lookup for that obj

      Proxy Obj := an Class or Object that is intended to store or hold another Object 

  => super just doesn't forward only attrib req & returnn res

  => 0 arg super gathers all the info it needs just by looking at Caller's Stack Frame
     |
     So when we do super()
     it actually sneakily grabs 2 variable underhood ie __class__ & self  (via Caller's Stack frame)
      1) __class__  :- class it's currently run from !
      2) self       :- object its currently being run on !

      So You can pass 2 argumments 

      Eg b = B()
         sup = super(B, b)   // B is class from where its being running on  & b is object on which its being running on  

* Cooperative Inheritance :
  ------
   -> A way to ensure that particular Parent's behaviour is invoked on super()


* bound methods vs free methods :
