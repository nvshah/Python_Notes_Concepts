TIP : Slicing is inclusive in pandas



--------------------------
df.dtypes // give info abt all types for all columns



______________

* Pandas : pd

* dataframe & series :
 
  - series = single array obj | single col of rows
  - df = container of series.

* index :
  _____
   -> label for row
   -> default (integers from 0,1,2,...) 


* iloc & loc :
  __________
 
  - to get row 

    loc -> by labels of index & iloc -> by index integer

    df.iloc[[list of indices for row], {index for column to select}]  // Eg df.iloc[[1,2], 2] will select 1&2 row with 3rd column

  - slicing works on column names as well
      df.loc[[lst of index], col1:col2]             // THis is the reason Slicing inclusive



Q Access multiple cols :  -> df[['col1', 'col2']]  // df[list of col_names]
Q to get rows :           -> df.iloc[i]
Q to get multiple rows :  -> df.iloc[[i1, i2]]     //df.iloc[list of indices] 

q to get multiple rows with selected cols : 
                        -> df.iloc[[i1, i2], [ci1, ci2]]  // df.iloc[[list of row index], [list of col index]]
                           df.loc[[i1, i2], [c1, c2]]  // df.iloc[[list of row index], [list of col names]]

q to get range of rows :  -> df.iloc[s:e, {[list of columns index]}]  //s-start, e-end both inclusive
                          -> df.loc[s:e, {[list of colmn names]}]  //s-start, e-end both inclusive
 
Q to get rows & col cnt : -> shape()

Q set col as index :->  df.set_index('col_name')

Q to check if series elem in series2 :- s1.isin(s2)

  to check if series elem has na :- s1.isna()


* Remember : 
   ----
    Masking only works with Boolean Series in pandas dataframe

   To do slice based on index :- df.iloc[i1:i2, j1:j2]

   if pd.concate() on axis = 0 then index will be repeated

   .loc can use labels & boolean array to access rows

   => The new DataFrame index is the union of the two Series indices:


* subset using 2 ways :  
  -----


* to_csv() :
  -----
   - doesn't limit you to create only csv files
   - you can create txt files with same method as well
