-------------------------------------

modules :- sys, shutil, fileinput


* To copy 1 file content to another file  :-
  
    shutil.copyfile()


  stdin -> input stream -> read from keyboard
  stdout -> output stream -> write to console

  stdin :- file descriptor 0
            cat file |yourprog
            #or
            yourprog <file

  stdout :- file descriptor 1
            yourprog | someotherprog #pipe your stdout to the stdin of another program
            yourprog > somefile #save stdout to a file
            yourprog >> somefile #append stdout to a file

   input() is api for sys.stdin  [i.e input() is calling stdin() internally]
   print() is api for sys.stdout [i.e print() is calling stdout() internally]


* sys.stdin :
  -------
   (ref : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/take-input-from-stdin-in-python/)

   sys.stdin ->
   sys.stdout

   sys.stdin.readline()
            .read()

   * To redirect read() input to some other file :

     python3 fName.py < ip.txt


   sys.stdout :
   -------
    * To redirect output to some other file :

      python3 fName.py > op.txt


NOTE :- Inorder to sync buffer, use flush() in between 2 write() operation

        i.e write()
            flush()
            write()

            Then you may see contents as expected Inorder
            but
            If you miss flush() then may be content are not in order


* fileinput ;
  --------
   modulename :- fileinput
      \
       fileinput.input()    // can be used to read lines from multiple files
         
          -> If no argument are passed then standard input i.e sys.stdin will be used as input
        
Q. Diff between stdin and input() 

 -> "sys.stdin.read()" is described as being able to take a newline 
    and finish your entry with Control+D. 
    input() would finish your entry with the "Enter" key being pressed on your keyboard, 
    so you couldn't include a newline in your data input that way.

 => stdin is used for all interactive input, including calls to input();
    stdout is used for the output of print() and expression statements and for the prompts of input()


=> GENERAL INFO :-
    1) If you want to read command line arguments :
           - sys.argv[i]
    
    2) If you want to read from prompt :
           - input() 

    3) from file or file like objects :
           - sys.stdin, fileinput()
