* Everything in Python is Object 

* blueprint :
  -------

   type class 
   __________
   -> Just as we create a blueprint for our custom object & we call them as a class !

      So how to define that class i.e blueprint is also governed by some other class in python 

       `type` class :-     Bluprint that allows you to define classes(custom objects)
       `function` class :- Blueprint that allows you to define your own function 
       `method` class :-   Blueprint that allows you to define your own method

   dynamically create class :
   ----------
    -> using type()
              \
               this procedure is often called as metaclass
