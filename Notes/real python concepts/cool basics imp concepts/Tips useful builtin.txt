Tips useful builtin

1) exec() & compile()
-----------------
Python’s built-in exec() function allows you to execute any piece of Python code.
With this function, you can execute dynamically generated code. Usually, it’s a string.

In practice, exec() can be quite slow when used to process strings containing code.

Compiling it beforehand will be the most performant and recommended approach
if you ever need to dynamically run a given piece of code more than once.
To do so, you can use `compile()`.

you can use the built-in open() function to read the file’s content as a string,
which you can then pass as an argument to exec()
