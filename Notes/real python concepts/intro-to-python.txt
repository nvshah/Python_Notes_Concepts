* modules that is part of python standard library -> 'batteries included'

* shebangs : 
  -------
   -> Interpreter directives, (present on first line of script that's to be run via cli)

* Every Python object contains at least a refcount 
  and a reference to the object's type in addition


* immutable vs mutable :
  ---------
   -> An immutable argument can never be modified by a function.
   -> A mutable argument canâ€™t be redefined wholesale, but it can be modified in place.

* __name__ 
  -------
   Standalone Script 

   => When a .py file is imported as a module, 
      Python sets the special dunder variable __name__ to the name of the module

=> When we use sys.argv list then, first element will be module_name if run from command line & not in idle
