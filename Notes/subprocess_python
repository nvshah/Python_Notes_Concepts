* subprocess : (module)
  ----------

  -> allows us to run system commands by using a function provided by subprocess module

  i.e subprocess.run(<List of cmd args>, <specify 2nd arg if you want>)

                  \
                   .stdout

      := { 2nd arg : capture_output, }

      :- the script is a parent process & creates a child proces that runs the system commands
         & only continue once child proces is completed

         by default output goes to standard output stream

         if you want to capture & prevent then use 2nd argument 
              => capture_output=True
