Tips :- 
----
 -> To compare any object to be instance of any class inside any method :
    Use -> isinstance(obj, self.__class__)  instead of className using directly

  
 -> dict does not provide you attribute lookup with their names i.e with dot notation 

 -> to get all the members that are funnctions of particular class 
      \
       -> inspect.getmembers(ClassName, inspect.isfunction)
