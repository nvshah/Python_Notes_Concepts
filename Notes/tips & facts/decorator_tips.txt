* Decorator Usefulness : (practical tips)
  -------------
 
  1) Timing functions :

      use time.perf_counter() 

      or 

      timeit module

  2) Register Plugins ;

      use this kinda architecture i.e light weight where you keep your function intact but register it inside 1 global
      registry

      so whenever you create function & want to register then just use decorator for that purpose

      Plus :- do not need to maintain list of which plugins exists  
              list is created when plugin register themselves
