Every file of python has it's Local-Symbol table 
                              ------------------

It simp to note that if python file is loaded  as module or itself it is a standalone script.

Module are often design to run as standalone script ( for testing purpose )

 1) Standalone script -> __name__ = '__main__' set by python

 2) as a module       -> __name__ = '__nameOfModule__' set by python


=> a module in one subpackage can reference objects in a sibling subpackage


Absolute import - pkgName.subPkgName.modName

Relative import - .. |  .     ( ..  refers to 1 package up
                                .   refers to current package )


Tip : You can use 
        from __main__ import obj   //for same file of python


* import any module from different directory :
  ------------
   trick -> do this before importing
       
           sys.path.append('../dir_name__path/')


           or 


           In VSCode Just in settings.json file add 

           relative path in list <---> python.analysis.extraPaths

           {
                   ...
           
                "python.analysis.extraPaths": [
                        "./tools"
                ]

                ...

           }
